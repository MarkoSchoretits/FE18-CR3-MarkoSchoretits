3rd Code Rewiev

This Project has been created as a solution to the 3rd Code Review on Frontend Web Development @ CodeFactory Vienna in 2023. As usual I provided 120%, which was computed as 100% acomplished. The task had been definend as described below the readme content created by Angular:


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

Code Review 3


Good morning students,

Welcome to your 3rd CodeReview. Time to show off with Angular!

You will need to achieve more than 60 points to pass this CodeReview successfully. 

You will be graded accordingly to the results achieved. Please see the number of points for each task below. 

The grading system has the following rules:

Up to 60 points = red

Between 61 and 79 = yellow

Over 80 = green

You can submit your solution (as GitHub project link) until Saturday 18:00:00.

 

 

Task description
Benvenuto al Ristorante Il Gambero Rosso. In this CodeReview, you have to create a Delivery page for the best Restaurant in Padova Province, in the North of Italy, using Angular obviously.  

GUI guideline: You are allowed to use CSS and/or bootstrap. 

In order to accomplish this project, you will need to create at least 7 pages/components: NavBar, Home, Footer, About Us, Menu, Details and Order(Cart) (you are free to create additional components if you have time and inspiration). The NavBar will be always showing no matter what component is triggered, the same for the Footer. Home and About Us should have static content. Menu will hold dynamic content created from objects. On clicking on the Details button it should lead to the details page which will bring specific information from that dish. 

  

Please examine the designs below as a suggestion: 

Home and About Us components will have static content and can have a similar design to the example below. Feel free to provide your content for those pages instead of LoremIpsumDolor üòä : 

    

 
 

The Menu component will hold the dynamic content and should present at least 6 dishes with their image, small description and price.  
 

Submission Guidelines: 

Submission guideline note: Standard submission procedure should be used, which includes: Creation of a GitHub project (repository name FE18-CR3-Name), ‚Äúpush‚Äù to the repository and provide the information to CodeFactory through the learning management system (https://lms.codefactory.live/) with the GitHub link for the cloning procedure. 

For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded: 

(05 points) Create a GitHub Repository named: FE18-CR3-Name.  

Push the files into it and send the link through the learning management system (lms). Add codefactorygit as a collaborator and assure your repository is set to private. See an example of a GitHub link below: 

https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git 

(10 points) The final result of your theme design must be responsive by using css or Bootstrap. 

(15 points) Your project must contain at least 7 components that together will build up your application as follows: NavBar, Home, Footer, About Us, Menu, Details and Order(Cart) 

(15 points) Use routing to move between the pages without refreshing the browser (SPA). The navbar contains the navigation links that allow you to go through the components and go back to the home page. 

(15 points) Each dish(object) must have at least the following properties: name, image, description, price and availability (Boolean). 

(10 points) If the availability of the dish is true, the buttons ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù and ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù must be shown in each dish. If it is false, it shouldn‚Äôt show the buttons for that object, only the dish picture with a message ‚ÄúNot available‚Äù, instead. 

(20 points) Create the functionality that when you click on Order button, the dish will be added to the cart. The user must be able to order as well from the Menu component or from the Details component. The Order component must show the content of the cart. 

(10 points) A details component must be created. It will hold specific information about the dish when clicked on the button Details. The user must be able to order from this component. 
 

Bonus Points: 

(10 points) Display the total of the Bill with a ‚ÄúService‚Äù section that shows 10% of the total amount. 

(10 points) If the Total sum is more than EUR 40, the user gets a 15% discount. The total without discount and the new price with the discount must be neatly shown on the screen.

0 to 90% took a couple hours, from 90% to 110% the whole night and the last 10% just two minutes. Pareto at it's best :)

Hey Markus, well done on completing your third code review. You have successfully managed to accomplish all the requirements from this cr. You have implemented all the necessary components, the functionality to add dishes to the cart from both the Menu and Details components is working perfectly, you also managed to achieve the bonus points. However I noticed that the order component's design could be improved for better user experience.
Overall good job. Keep up the good work.
Riola
